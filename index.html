      </div>
      <div class="col-md-6 col-sm">
        <p class="second-paragraph ">When Goodfellas was being filmed, Martin Scorsese, recalls the unexpected improvised joke from Joe Pesci in a scene in which fully depicts their dark nature and he kept it in. But why mention this?. Why is this so important in further progressing filmmaking?

Martin Scorsese demonstrates us this one key idea which is vital to answering this question:


Always be open to new ideas 

If we are not open to new ideas, how are you going to expect growth within skill sets and how your shots are produced. Martin Scorsese didn’t expect this improvised line from his actor but he overall embraced it by keeping it within the movie knowing it was going to pursue a more in-depth analysis of the characters. 
All in all, to truly innovate a piece of cinema, it does not have to be the craziest idea, only that in the end all that you’re pursuing is a more deeper and story driven piece of filmmaking to be produced. </p>

      <p>We all know that equipment can be quite costly and expensive for anyone starting out in the field of video.

      <p>So in order to address this, I wanted to first take into account how people starting out can begin making their own films without the limitations of money or expensive equipment. Then I would come up with an idea that would innovate the art of cinematography and everyone involved. </p>
