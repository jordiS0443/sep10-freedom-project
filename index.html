From how the camera is angled to the lighting that sets the scenery , cinematography plays a crucial role in the entertainment we see a lot. Though we may not focus on it sometimes, it is always there! And if we look closer with a new perspective, you can see the details from the cinematographers that have the opportunity to further drive the story into a whole different world.</p>

      </div>
      <div class="col-md-6 col-sm">
        <p class="second-paragraph ">When Goodfellas was being filmed, Martin Scorsese, the director, recalls an unexpected and improvised joke from Joe Pesci in a scene in which fully depicts his dark nature and the overall tension of the scene. Even though it was unexpected, he still kept it in. But why mention this? Why is this so important in further progressing filmmaking?

Well, what Martin Scorsese demonstrates us here is a one key idea which is vital to answering this question, which is:


<b>Always be open to new ideas. </b>

If we are not open to new ideas, how are you going to expect growth within skill sets and how your shots are overall produced. Martin Scorsese didn’t expect this improvised line from his actor but he overall embraced it by keeping it within the movie knowing it was going to pursue a more in-depth analysis of the characters. This shows that 
 to truly innovate a piece of cinema, it does not have to be the craziest idea, only that in the end all that you’re pursuing is a more deeper and story driven piece of filmmaking to be produced. </p>

  <div class="row">
         <p class="innovation-pg">We all know that equipment can be quite costly and expensive for anyone starting out in the field of video. From quality cameras having a price tag in the thousands to lenses literally breaking the bank, all of this can be quite discouraging for beginners to continue to pursue all of this.</p>
      <p style="color:white; font-familly:'Open Sans', sans-serif;">So in order to address this, I wanted to first take into account how people starting out can begin making their own films without the limitations of money or expensive equipment. Then I would come up with an idea that would innovate the art of cinematography and everyone involved. </p>
  </div> <!--- row div -->
</div> <!-- container -->

 <hr style="color:white;">  
 <div class="container">
   <div class="row">
     <div class="col-md-6">
       <p style="margin-top:30px; color:white; font-family:'Open Sans', sans-serif;">So I present to you my idea: A camera rig that connects to your phone and helps guide the user in terms of exposure, lighting, and other helpful tips with the help of included software built in. Additionally, the rig cage itself is a stablizer that can be used for smooth cinematic movement. The goal for this innovation is to present an affordable yet informative solution for beginner filmakers who do not want to spend the money on expensive equipment yet.  </p>
       <p style="font-family:'Open Sans', sans-serif; color:white;"> Allow me to provide an example on how all this works. Let's say you are going to film an interview and you have the proper lighting ready but your image is coming out a little bright, or a little overexposed. The hardware, which connects through whatever port is compatible with your phone, will open up the software and will inform the user that the image needs a couple tweaks in the exposure/brightness. Furthermore, the software will also use this as an opportunity to teach the user how to use the proper tools like the historgram for future use. All in all, this can be extremeley  helpful in both expanding on knowledge and skillset for future projects</p>
        <p style="font-family:'Open Sans', sans-serif; color:white;"> But it's not only exposure or proper lighting of the camera that this innovation contributes to. The invention also further utilizes the power of Artificial Intelligence to better inform the user how to enhance the image and make it look more cinematic. An example of this would be in how the A.I would help contribute to adding a depth of field to the subject without the need of any expensive lens, or any color presets to make the image pop!. Furthermore, the A.I would would also help with post editing the footage that was captured to give the filmaker an idea on how the scene will look like with the shots they took.   </p>

       This topic has always brought great interest to me ever since I’ve been introduced to the whole field of video production. Since then, I have been mindful of details within movies and tv-shows and how the story drives from it. I also began taking mental notes in my head on how intentional the editing, the setting, the props, the camera angles were to a certain scene or the whole length of the video.  But overall, I believe cinematography is sometimes overlooked and I think if more casual viewers are aware of the process and detail within, I believe that it will cause more inspiration for even greater films or show ideas to be produced.

       Throughout the crazy and wild year known as 2020, I was given the opportunity to serve at my local church called Resurrection Church producing videos for the youtube channel (Sunday Services, Worship,etc,).With that opportunity, I was given a lot of creative freedom in how I can further elevate, let's say, the way worship is filmed or welcome videos are made.
       
       I took the opportunity to do that. When I film a worship set, I think to myself, how can I really depict the emotion of this song? and how can I represent the way the lyrics are being sung by these singers?. So I take mental notes and practice the movement of the camera gimbal I am holding but also taking into account how I am going to edit this footage later. Overall, I feel like this process has helped me into thinking more than just the technicalities of things because it’s not just putting clips together and pressing the record button on the cameras. But instead it is the way we are able to deliver these moments that is being recorded

       This question gets thrown around a lot, usually in different interpretations, but in my opinion I believe no. I think that the overall thought process a person puts into their project (film,short video,etc.) can really define how much effort and their work as a filmmaker. It doesn’t matter if you have RED cameras, or amazing sound equipment, if the idea isn’t present when someone press records, the overall motion picture is not going to be visually appealing. In the end what I learned and what I advise you to take into mind is that don’t get discouraged and compare yourself to others with expensive equipment and other gear but instead take it as an opportunity to challenge yourself to thrive for something amazing.
